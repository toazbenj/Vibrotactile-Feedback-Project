Hardware Support
================

Support for different input devices is increasing over time. Currently
tested hardware combinations are as listed below.

If one of these combinations does not work, that is likely a bug,
while support for new devices is a feature request.

Linux

* All USB Keyboards
* All USB Mice
* Laptop built in keyboard and touchpads
* Xbox 360 Controller via USB cable
* Xbox One Controller via USB cable
* PS4 Controller via USB cable
* PS3 Controller via USB cable (press PS button if controller is not awake)

Raspberry Pi
------------

All the above devices listed under Linux, plus:

Raspberry Pi Sense HAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The microcontroller on the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT presents the
joystick to the operating system as a keyboard, so find it there under
keyboards. If you worry about this, you are over-thinking things.

Raspberry Pi Touch Screen

This presents as a mouse. Again please do not over think it.

Windows
-------

* All USB Keyboards
* All USB Mice
* Laptop built in keyboard and touchpads
* Xbox 360 Controller via USB cable
* Xbox One Controller via USB cable

PS4 DualShock 4 Controller

Install the Windows driver from http://ds4windows.com/

Then it works perfectly. Even the touchpad works as a mouse.
